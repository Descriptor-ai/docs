  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Customer Experience Associates">
    Our solution is designed to help Customer Experience Associates (CEAs) analyze customer interactions, providing insights into customer sentiment, emotions, and dialogue.
    Besides that, we also provide a set of tools to help CEAs to analyze the quality of their agents' performance. 
    Check out our [Demo for free](https://demo.descriptor.ai/) to get started.

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Sales and Marketing Teams">
   Empathy mapping is a technique used in sales and marketing to understand and empathize with customers. 
   It involves creating a detailed map of the customer's journey, including their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
   While we can't help with empathy mapping, we can help sales and marketing teams to understand their customers' needs and preferences, and to develop more effective strategies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="user-tie" title="Management Representatives">
    Management Representatives (MRs) are responsible for overseeing the performance of their teams and ensuring that customer needs are met.
    Our solution provides MRs with the tools to analyze already recorded caller data to identify areas for improvement and to train their agents to better meet customer needs.
