   Empathy mapping is a technique used in sales and marketing to understand and empathize with customers. 
   It involves creating a detailed map of the customer's journey, including their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
   While we can't help with empathy mapping, we can help sales and marketing teams to understand their customers' needs and preferences, and to develop more effective strategies.

    Management Representatives (MRs) are responsible for overseeing the performance of their teams and ensuring that customer needs are met.
