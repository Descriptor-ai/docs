# Descriptor.AI API Documentation

Descriptor.AI provides an advanced audio file analysis API, designed to process customer-agent conversations with granular insights. 
It accepts audio files via a link in a JSON API request, specifying configuration options such as transcription, speech emotion recognition, sentiment analysis, and various dialogue insights. 
The analysis workflow is multi-phased, starting with speech recognition (ASR) for each channel, followed by optional speech emotion recognition (SER) per channel. 
The final output provides insights, metrics, and emotional data for in-depth analysis.
