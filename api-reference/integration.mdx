## Overview

Integrating the Descriptor.AI API for offline processing is straightforward. The process involves two main steps:

1. Uploading an audio file for analysis
2. Retrieving the analysis results using the returned ID

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using a Bearer token. You'll receive your access token upon signup.

## Basic Integration Flow

Here's a typical integration flow:

1. Send a POST request to `/api/v1/offline/process` with your audio file
2. Receive a `result_id` in the response
3. Poll the `/api/v1/offline/processing/{result_id}` endpoint until processing is complete
4. Retrieve the full analysis results
