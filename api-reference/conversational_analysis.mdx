Our advanced conversation intelligence suite transforms your customer interactions into actionable business insights. By leveraging our domain expertise and cutting-edge AI, we analyze conversations across multiple dimensions to provide comprehensive analytics that drive business value.

The suite consists of two main components: Strategic Insights for high-level business intelligence, and Advanced Analytics for detailed conversation analysis. 

Each component offers multiple specialized tools designed to give you deep understanding of your customer interactions.

Our API allows to build custom workflows and integrate with your existing systems, but if you need a ready-to-use solution, please contact our [sales](mailto:alexa@descriptor.ai) team,
