## Is my data secure?

Yes, your data is secure with Descriptor.AI. We use industry-standard encryption and security protocols to protect your data.
While we do not store any audio and voice and don't send it to any third-party services, we do use LLMs to analyze the data.

## Is there a way to deploy Descriptor.AI on-premises?
Yes, we support on-premise deployments for organizations that require additional security measures, including our optimized LLMs.
Please contact [us](mailto:alexa@descriptor.ai) to learn more.

## What emotions do you detect in voice? 
Currently, we support speech emotion recognition to detect frustrated, cheerful, neutral and stressed states. 
Additionally, we are improving our model to learn more emotions from the context while trying to exclude the ambiguity and cross-validate the result. 

## How it is different from sentiment analysis from the text? 
An answer is in the question. While sentiment analysis is about sentiment detection from the text only, 
we use an audio as an input with an option to identify emotional cues based on the additional contextual recognition.


## What languages do you support?

We support ASR in multiple languages, including English, Hebrew, Hindi, Spanish, French, German and Italian. 
Speech Emotion Recognition is supported for English, Hebrew, Spanish and Italian. 

We are working hard on adding Speech Emotion Recognition for the rest of the languages, and we can expand the list of supported languages on demand.
